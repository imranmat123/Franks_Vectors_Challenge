Exercise 7.1 "Frank's Vectors Challenge" in C++ requires you to create two empty vectors named vector1 and vector2, respectively. Next, you need to add 10 and 20 to vector1 dynamically using the push_back method and display the elements and size of vector1 using the at() and size() methods, respectively. Similarly, add 100 and 200 to vector2 using the push_back method and display the elements and size of vector2 using the at() and size() methods, respectively.

After that, you need to declare an empty 2D vector named vector_2d, which is a vector of vector<int> and add vector1 and vector2 dynamically to vector_2d using the push_back method. Display the elements of vector_2d using the at() method. Then, change the value of vector1.at(0) to 1000 and display the elements of vector_2d using the at() method again. Finally, display the elements of vector1.
